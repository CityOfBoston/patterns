// 1/2019: Optimistic Blue and Freedom Red have each been split to have a -dark and -light variation. The original
// values now exist as the -light variation; -dark was added to provide stronger contrast and readability when used as
// text on a light background.

// todo: Because this stylesheet has many instances of the old variables, and because text-on-light is the most common
// situation, these backup variables reference the -dark variants. QA has reviewed these changes on staging as well. At
// some point in the future, we can assess each usage and assign the most appropriate variation in each instance.
$optimistic-blue  = $optimistic-blue-dark
$freedom-red      = $freedom-red-dark
